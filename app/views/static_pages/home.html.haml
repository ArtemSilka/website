    Coins' History

  %h3 Private Sync
  %p Chaincase keeps your transaction data private by #{link_to "taking full advantage of bitcoin's design", "https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/WalletLoad.html#synchronization", target: :_blank}. Other wallets take advantage of their central power and can see how much coin you have, where you get it, and how you use it. You verify using the network instead of just trusting us.
