    Clear your <br/>
    Coins' History

  %h3 Private Sync
  %p Chaincase keeps your transaction data private by taking full advantage of bitcoin's decentralized design. Other wallets take advantage of their central power and can see how much coin you have, where you get it, and how you use it. We help you verify using #{link_to "Neutrino", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/neutrino-privacy-preserving-light-wallet-protocol", target: :_blank} instead of just trusting us.
